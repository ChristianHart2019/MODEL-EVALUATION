# Create files that will control SUMMA runs and their parameters
Use the CREATE_SUMMA_ATTRIBUTES.sh python script to create a set of SUMMA attribute files that are specific to individual snoTEL stations. The size of the attribute fileâ€™s dimensions must be the same as that in the snoTEL forcing files. This script extracts data from the original SUMMA data files and ensures that the new information written to file is consistent with the measurement specifications of the snoTEL stations.
